 * Implements Multi-AIL (Adjacent Infrastructure Link) detection.
 *
 * This class detects whether Border Routers (BRs) may be connected to different AILs by tracking the number of peer
 * BRs from Network Data versus from `RxRaTracker`. If the Network Data count exceeds the RA-tracked count for more
 * than `kDetectTime` (10 minutes), it notifies this using a callback. To clear the state, `kClearTime` (1 minute) is
 * used.
 *
 * This longer detection window of 10 minutes helps to avoid false positives due to transient changes. `RxRaTracker`
 * uses 200 seconds for reachability checks of peer BRs. Stale Network Data entries are also expected to age out
 * within a few minutes, so a 10-minute detection time accommodates both.
